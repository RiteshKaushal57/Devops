## What is the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?
Docker is a containerization platform — it helps you build, package, and run applications inside containers. Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool — it helps you manage, scale, and automate the deployment of those containers.  

## Why Kubernetes is used?
Kubernetes is used because it solves limitations that Docker has. So basically, Docker can run only on a single host, cannot auto-scale or self-heal containers, and lacks enterprise-level features. But Kubernetes solves these limitations by running containers across multiple nodes in a cluster, automatically scaling applications based on demand using Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, self-healing failed containers by restarting or rescheduling them, and providing enterprise-grade features like load balancing, rolling updates, and persistent storage.
