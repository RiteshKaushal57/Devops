## What is the difference between Docker and Kubernetes?
Docker is a containerization platform — it helps you build, package, and run applications inside containers. Kubernetes is a container orchestration tool — it helps you manage, scale, and automate the deployment of those containers.  

## Why Kubernetes is used?
Kubeernetes is used because Docker has some limitations. It can run only on a single host, cannot auto-scale or self-heal containers, and lacks enterprise-level features. Kubernetes is used to solve these problems by orchestrating containers across multiple machines, enabling auto-scaling, self-healing, and providing enterprise-grade management for production workloads.
