## What is IaC?
Infrastructure as Code means setting up and managing infrastructure using code instead of doing it by hand. The reason it’s used is because it saves a lot of time, reduces mistakes, and keeps all environments consistent. It works by writing a configuration file that describes what kind of setup you want — like your servers or databases — and tools such as Terraform automatically create that setup for you. So, it makes managing infrastructure as easy and reliable as writing software code.

## What is Terraform?
Terraform is a tool that allows you to manage infrastructure using code rather than doing everything manually. It’s used because it automates the setup, reduces human errors, and ensures that the same infrastructure can be recreated easily across different environments. It works by writing configuration files that describe what resources you need, and Terraform reads those files to automatically create, update, or delete the infrastructure as needed. This makes managing cloud resources fast, consistent, and reliable.

## What are Providers?
In Terraform, providers are like plugins that let Terraform connect and work with different platforms such as AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. We use providers because Terraform itself can’t directly communicate with these platforms — the provider acts as a bridge that tells Terraform how to create and manage resources there. It works by declaring the provider in the configuration file, and when we run terraform init, Terraform automatically downloads and sets up that provider. After that, it can use the provider to manage the resources we define in our code.
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0" # Change the AMI 
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

## What is Multi Region?
In Terraform, multi-region means setting up your infrastructure in more than one cloud region, like having some servers in Mumbai and others in Singapore. It’s done to make your system more reliable and faster — if one region fails, the other keeps running, and users from different places get better performance. It works by defining multiple provider blocks in Terraform, each pointing to a different region. Terraform then uses those providers to create resources across all the regions you’ve mentioned in your configuration.
```
provider "aws" {
  alias = "us-east-1"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias = "us-west-2"
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  provider = "aws.us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example2" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  provider = "aws.us-west-2"
}
```

## What is  Multi Cloud?
Multi-cloud means using more than one cloud platform at the same time — like combining AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud based on your needs. It’s done mainly to avoid relying on a single provider, improve reliability, and make use of each cloud’s strengths. In Terraform, this is very easy to manage because you can define multiple providers in the same project, and Terraform will automatically create and manage resources across all those clouds using one set of configuration files. This gives full control over different cloud environments from a single tool.
```
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "your-azure-subscription-id"
  client_id = "your-azure-client-id"
  client_secret = "your-azure-client-secret"
  tenant_id = "your-azure-tenant-id"
}
```
```
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "example" {
  name = "example-vm"
  location = "eastus"
  size = "Standard_A1"
}
```
## What are variables?
In Terraform, variables are used to store values like region names, instance types, or project names so that we don’t have to repeat them everywhere in the code. They make our configuration flexible and easier to maintain. For example, if we want to change a region or instance type, we just update the variable once instead of editing multiple files. We usually define variables in a variables.tf file and assign values in a terraform.tfvars file or from the command line. This helps keep the code clean, reusable, and easy to manage across different environments.

## What are conditions?
Conditions in Terraform are used to make decisions within our code, similar to an if–else statement. They help us choose different values or configurations based on certain situations. For example, we can say — if the environment is production, use a bigger instance type; otherwise, use a smaller one. Terraform uses a simple ternary operator to do this, which looks like a short if–else expression. This makes the setup smarter, because Terraform automatically adjusts the configuration based on the condition we define.

## What are Modules?
In Terraform, modules are like reusable blocks of code that help organize and simplify your setup. Instead of writing the same Terraform configuration multiple times, you can define it once as a module and use it anywhere. It’s mainly used to make the code cleaner, more modular, and easier to maintain. A module usually contains files like main.tf, variables.tf, and outputs.tf. We can then call that module from our main Terraform file using a module block. This approach saves time, avoids duplication, and keeps the infrastructure setup more consistent and manageable.

## What is Terraform State?
Terraform keeps track of all the infrastructure it creates using something called a state file.
Think of it like Terraform’s memory — it remembers what resources it built and their current status.
This is important because Terraform uses this state to know what already exists, so it only changes what’s necessary instead of rebuilding everything.

It works by saving all the resource details inside a .tfstate file, which it then compares against your configuration code each time you run a plan or apply.
In teams, this state is often kept in a remote backend like AWS S3 so everyone works from the same source of truth.
In short, Terraform state ensures consistency, helps track resources, and makes infrastructure updates safe and predictable.

What is a Remote Backend?
In Terraform, a remote backend is simply a place to store the Terraform state file in the cloud instead of keeping it locally.

This is really useful when working in teams or CI/CD pipelines because it provides a single source of truth for the entire infrastructure.
By storing the state in something like an S3 bucket with DynamoDB for locking, Terraform ensures that everyone works on the same state and prevents two people from applying changes at the same time.
It also makes state more secure and recoverable if a local system fails.

So, using a remote backend basically helps keep your Terraform setup collaborative, consistent, and safe.

## What is State Locking?
State locking in Terraform is a safety mechanism that ensures only one person or process can modify the state file at a time.
It’s important because if multiple people run Terraform simultaneously, it can corrupt the state or cause inconsistent infrastructure.

When you use a remote backend like AWS S3 with DynamoDB, Terraform automatically creates a lock before applying any changes and releases it afterward.
If someone else tries to make a change while the lock is active, Terraform simply blocks it until the current process finishes.

So, in short — state locking keeps Terraform operations safe, consistent, and conflict-free when working in teams or CI/CD.

## What are Provisioners?
In Terraform, provisioners are used to run scripts or commands on a resource after it’s created.
They’re mainly used for configuration tasks — for example, installing software, setting up environment variables, or copying files to a new server.

There are different types like remote-exec (to run commands on the resource), local-exec (to run commands on your local system), and file (to copy files).
Terraform connects to the instance via SSH or WinRM and executes these actions automatically after creation.

However, provisioners are considered a last resort — HashiCorp recommends using tools like Ansible or Packer for configuration management instead.
Provisioners are best for small setup steps that can’t be done directly through Terraform resources.

## What are Terraform Workspaces?
Terraform Workspaces let us manage multiple environments — like dev, staging, and production — using the same codebase but with separate state files.
This means we can reuse the same Terraform configuration and still keep each environment isolated.

Each workspace maintains its own state file, so any changes in one workspace don’t affect the others.
For example, if I create a resource in the “dev” workspace, it won’t exist in the “prod” workspace until I apply there separately.

Workspaces are helpful for testing and environment separation, but for larger projects, teams often use separate backends or folders for even clearer isolation.
Still, they’re great for small-to-medium setups or quick environment management.

## What is Secrets Management?
Secrets management in Terraform means securely handling sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and tokens that are required during infrastructure provisioning.
Instead of hardcoding secrets inside Terraform files or variables, we store them in a secrets manager such as HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault.

Terraform then fetches these secrets dynamically and securely at runtime.
This approach helps maintain security, compliance, and automation, ensuring that secrets are never exposed in version control or Terraform state files.

In short, secrets management keeps your infrastructure safe from leaks and unauthorized access while letting Terraform work seamlessly.

## What is Terraform Vault Integration?
Terraform integrates with HashiCorp Vault to securely manage and access secrets like API keys, passwords, or tokens during infrastructure deployment.
Instead of hardcoding credentials in Terraform files, Terraform uses the Vault provider to fetch secrets dynamically at runtime.

This makes infrastructure both secure and automated — Vault handles secret rotation and encryption, while Terraform focuses on building resources.
For example, when provisioning a database, Terraform can directly pull the username and password from Vault without ever exposing them in the state or code.

In short, Terraform + Vault is a powerful combination that brings security, compliance, and automation together in Infrastructure as Code.
