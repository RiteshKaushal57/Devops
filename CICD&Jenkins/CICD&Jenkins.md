## What is CI/CD?
CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery/Deployment.
CI automatically builds and tests code whenever developers make changes, while CD automates the deployment process.
Together, they help deliver software faster, with fewer errors, and make the release process more consistent and reliable.

## Why CI/CD?
CI/CD is used because it automates the entire software delivery process, helping teams release updates faster and with fewer errors.
Itâ€™s important because, in traditional development, integrating code manually and deploying it by hand often causes delays, bugs, and inconsistencies between environments. CI/CD solves that by continuously building, testing, and deploying code through automation.
This means developers get quick feedback on their changes, issues are caught early, and users receive new features or fixes faster.
